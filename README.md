# SimGAN
This project was done as part of the course requirement for Introduction to Deep Learning for Computer Vision taught by Dr. Kwang Moo Yi at University of Victoria. 

- This project is the re-implementation of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828)

- In this project, I used SIMGAN network to make the synthetic images more realistic. For this, I used the synthetic images generated from Unity simulator.

- Results and discussion about the project are available in **report.pdf**
